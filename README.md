	-	back-end Rails project (produces API)

### Requirements

-	You'll be assigned a pair to work with.
-	Work should happen at TIY and outside as you see fit.
-	One of you will work on the front-end Rails, and another on the back-end API project.

### Backend

#### Rails API Abilities

-	Create a User (email/name/secure-password) which sets a secure random key when created.
-	Create a "Sshhh" model where users can post "sshhh" (secrets)
-	Ability to Create Users
-	Ability to sign in
-	Ability to post a sshhh
-	Ability to pull the latest 20 sshhh's

-	Ability to create a user
-	Ability to sign in a user
-	Ability to show latest sshhh's on homepage
